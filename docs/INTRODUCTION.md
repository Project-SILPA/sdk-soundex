Soundex
=======

Soundex is a phonetic indexing algorithm. Its primary objective is to compare words that have similar pronunciation but different spelling. It currently supports all Indian languages and English, and provides intra-indic string comparison. 

Soundex was developed by Robert C. Russell and Margaret K. Odell. However, the algorithm developed was designed only for English. Swathanthra Malayalam Computing developed Soundex for Indic languages. Using this module, texts can be compared for similarity in pronunciation even if they belong to different Indic languages.

This module is a Java implementation of Soundex module developed by SMC and is a part of SILPA Android SDK.
